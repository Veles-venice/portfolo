# 💫 My Portfolio — A Subtle Flex of Code & Charm    

Welcome to my digital playground.  
This portfolio is built from scratch — pure **HTML** and **CSS**, no frameworks, no shortcuts.  
Just me, a blank screen, and a lot of late-night energy turning pixels into something worth staring at.  

## ✨ What’s Inside  
- Smooth transitions that move just right.  
- Clean layouts that don’t beg for attention — they *earn* it.  
- A contact form that actually works (because what’s a little mystery without a way to reach me?).  
- A touch of color theory, a dash of symmetry, and a whole lot of confidence.  

## 💌 Why It Exists  
Because design is like flirting — subtle, balanced, and never desperate.  
This portfolio doesn’t scream *“look at me”* — it whispers *“stay a little longer.”*  

Feel free to explore, click around, and maybe get lost in the details.  
After all, if a static site can hold your attention — imagine what else I could build. 😉
